        details
        <p1>This is a basic website made by static-#4196 on discord. this will showcase my skills and projects, future
            projects and current ones.</p1>
        <h2>Basic skills : </h2>
        <!-- skills and details about them-->
        <p1>
            my basic skills are based on development and basic technological knowledge, based off of linux machines,
            basic
            programming languages from HTML, CSS, JS, PYTHON, PHP, and learning more. I have made basic malware
            specifically
            ransomware ( without the ransom method added ) and a Worm that infects the machine without being detected
            and
            spreading itself through out contact of other macines ( if a usb is pluged in it will clear it out and
            install
            the worm then infect other machines the usb is pluged into.)

        </p1>

        <h2>My goals for the future</h2>

            softwares yet) any jobs that include simple hacking ( ethicly) and programming is greatly needed for me in
            the
            future</p2>
